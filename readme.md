- **Security**: Basic authentication with role-based access control (Admin, User).

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- H2 Database (in-memory)
- Stripe Payment Integration
- Lombok (for reducing boilerplate code)
- JUnit and Mockito (for testing)
- Swagger (for API documentation)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or later
- Maven
- Stripe account (for payment integration)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/
   cd ecommerce-product-management
   ```

2. Configure the Stripe API Key:
   - Sign up for a Stripe account and get your **secret key**.
   - Add the secret key to your `application.properties`:
     ```properties
     stripe.secret.key=your-stripe-secret-key
     ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. The application will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Database Setup

This project uses H2 as the in-memory database. When you run the application, the database is automatically initialized with tables and sample data using `schema.sql` and `data.sql`.

You can access the H2 console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` using the following credentials:
- **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- **Username**: `sa`
- **Password**:

### Example Requests

#### Create a New Product (Admin Only)
```http
POST /api/products/admin
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Laptop",
  "description": "A powerful gaming laptop",
  "price": 1200.00,
  "stockQuantity": 10
}
```

#### Register a Customer
```http
POST /api/customers/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "phoneNumber": "1234567890"
}
```

#### Place an Order
```http
POST /api/orders
```

#### Process Payment for an Order
```http
POST /api/orders/pay/1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

stripeToken=tok_visa
```

## Payment Integration

The project integrates with **Stripe** for handling payments. To process payments:
1. Customers place an order.
2. After placing an order, call the `/api/orders/pay/{orderId}` endpoint with a valid Stripe token (e.g., `tok_visa` for testing).
3. Stripe token can be generated `/api/genrateToken`
4. The payment is processed, and if successful, the order status is updated to `PAID`.

Make sure to use your **Stripe secret key** in the `application.properties` for real-world payment processing.

### Stripe Test Cards
For testing, you can use the following **Stripe test card**:
- **Card Number**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Expiry Date**: Any valid future date
- **CVC**: Any 3-digit number

## Security Configuration

The application uses **Spring Security** to secure the API endpoints.

### Authentication:
- **Basic Authentication** is used.
- **In-memory users**:
  - Admin credentials(`/api/signup/admin`):
    - Username: `admin`
    - Password: `adminpass`
  - User credentials(`/api/signup/user`):
    - Username: `user`
    - Password: `userpass`

### Role-based Access Control:
- Admins can manage products.
- Users and Admins can place orders and manage customer profiles.

You can modify the security settings and user roles in the `SecurityConfig.java` file.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Unit tests for services are written using **JUnit** and **Mockito**. You can run the tests using:
```bash
mvn test
```

### API Testing
Use **Postman** or **cURL** to test the REST APIs. Make sure to include the appropriate **Basic Auth credentials** when accessing protected endpoints.

## Documentation

The project includes **Swagger** for API documentation. After running the application, you can access the Swagger UI at:
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

This UI provides detailed information on all the available API endpoints, along with request/response examples.
